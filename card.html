            <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is the most common coding language in use today 
        around the world. This is for a good reason: most web browsers 
        utilize it and it’s one of the easiest languages to learn. 
        JavaScript requires almost no prior coding knowledge — once
         you start learning, you can practice and play with it immediately. </p>
